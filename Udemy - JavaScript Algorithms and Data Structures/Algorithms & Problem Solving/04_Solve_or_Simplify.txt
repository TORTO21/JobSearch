Solve the problem if you can.
If you can't!
Solve a simpler problem.  Ignore the part that is giving you a really hard time to address everything else

You want to have something to show for yourself
Getting stuck on one part of a problem and making 0 progress at all looks bad.

It's much better to start writing code to do the stuff you know how to do keeping in mind you need to incorporate the harder part of the problem.

Simplify:
  1. Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
  2. Temporarily ingore that difficulty
  3. Write a simplified solution
  4. Then incorporate that difficulty back in

Example: Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each letter in a string
